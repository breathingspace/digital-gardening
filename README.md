# a guide to digital gardens

> A digital garden is a kind of digital refuge, a retreat to get in touch with your own ideas. Basically, it is usually a website, a kind of chaotic blog made up of unfinished text fragments, notes and ideas. These ideas undergo constant development by the author, sometimes merging and refining them.
